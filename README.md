## What is this?

Every time you press **Enter** or your AI does something, a neon whip animation slashes across your screen with a satisfying slap sound. The more you mash, the spicier the phrases get.

It's dumb. It's beautiful. It works.

## How it works

🍑 **Global Enter key** — works in any app, any terminal, anywhere

🔗 **Kiro deep integration** — auto-installs hooks that trigger on:
- Prompt submissions
- File edits
- Tool executions (shell, MCP, writes)
- Task completions
- Agent stop

⌨️ **Streak mode** — mash Enter for escalating intensity:

| Hits | Vibe | Examples |
|------|------|----------|
| 1-2 | Casual | "spank that code", "bad code bad" |
| 3-5 | Warming up | "HARDER", "FASTER", "dont stop" |
| 6-9 | Getting hot | "oh behave", "right there", "keep going" |
| 10-14 | Almost there | "ALMOST THERE", "so close", "yes yes yes" |
| 15+ | Climax | "SHIPPED 🚀", "i need a cigarette", "was it good for you" |

## Features

- 🎨 **Dreamy neon whip** — color-shifting glow, rainbow trail, twinkling sparkles
- 🔊 **Satisfying audio** — whoosh on swing, slap on crack
- 🍑 **Streak system** — escalating phrases based on rapid hits
- 📊 **Insights** — track your whips, earn personas (Fresh Egg → Clanker → Whip Royalty)
- 🔗 **Kiro hooks** — auto-installed, zero config
- ⌨️ **Global Enter** — works everywhere
- 🖥️ **Menu bar app** — pause, volume, install hooks, quit
- 🎬 **Cinematic onboarding** — transparent overlay with ambient glow

- `postTaskExecution` — when a spec task completes
- `agentStop` — when the agent finishes
